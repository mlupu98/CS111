Project 4A consisted of setting up the beaglebone for the following projects. We had to take multiple screenshots
of the things we did during the setup. The following are the files present in the tar file.

my_beaglebone.jpg: a picture of me holding my beaglebone

connected.png: a screenshot of the terminal connect to the beaglenbone after the ifconfig command was issued

copy.png: a screenshot of the filezilla app with the HelloWorld file on both my local PC and the beaglebone

build_run: a screenshot of the compilation of HelloWorld by using the command gcc -o and the resulting output
after running the executable

git.png: a screenshot of the current git version running on the beaglebone and the result of the git clone command
after cloning my CS111 github repository

The step that I had most problem with was initially connecting to the beaglebone. At first it would not connect
through the USB and would give me errors. I had to unplug it a few times before it worked. I had the same issue
with the wireless connection. Also I had to flash my beaglebone before starting the project. The resources I used
were simply the ones offered on the specifcation.
